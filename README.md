# Conclusion of analysis

There is an apparent positive correlation between metrics that measure happiness and the maximum daily increase in covid19 cases in a country. Possible reasons are:

Happier countries are more likely to have widespread testing, therefore more cases
Happier countries are less likely to adhere to strict lockdowns, therefore generating more cases To test the above hypothesis, we could do the same analysis for number of deaths instead of cases.
A potential confounding bias that needs to be investigated is whether a higher daily increase in cases is correlated with the country's population size, and whether a country's size is positively correlated to its happiness
